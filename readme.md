# Node Docker Demo

This is a simple Express app to demonstrate using Docker for local NodeJS app development. Explore the `app/routes` directory to see which routes are available.

## Quickstart

- Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/karllhughes/node-docker-demo.git`
- If you have npm installed on your host machine, you can run the shortcut commands:
  - Build the Docker image: `npm run build`.
  - Run the container: `npm run start`.
  - The application will be running at `localhost:3000/`

If you don't want to run the npm commands on your machine, just take a look at the Docker commands in the `package.json` file for insight into what's going on behind the scenes.
